you know the famous text "fi yuo cna raed tihs" , this repo is python program that can change this text or any other text written in the same way to fully English readable words 

<h1>The Rules</h1> 
you need to make sure to keep the first and the last letter as the original word and reassemble the middle ones
don't remove any letters form the word the program is not capable of handling such changes

# there are four versions (python files) that do relatively the same thing but with some exceptions

same goes here the <b>"simpleFullTextConverter.py"</b>  is a program that can convert a full text file <br>
its data is also limted so if the program couldn't reassemble alot of words from your text , try <b>"complexFullTextConverter.py"</b> instead
